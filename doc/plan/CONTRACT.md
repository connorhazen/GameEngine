#Team Contract
####gridGUYS - Connor & Charles


## Team Work Goals

* Communicate often about which segment of project you are tackling.

* Merge and pull after each new feature to reduce redundant coding and facilitate
more seamless workflow. 

* Dont push broken or untested code to master. 

* Abide by established API's when adding features, if changes are necessary alert the other member.

##Responsibilities

Since we are just a two person group, we are not pre establishing which components are each members.
Instead, we will play it by year as we code depending on how fast each feature is implemented. 
This does mean communication is crucial so that we do not overlap coding or mess up an integration.
